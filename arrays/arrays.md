# Arrays and their Operators
- An array is like a list of values
- Index always starts at 0

## Outputting a Structured View of Arrays
- To print an array, we can use `print_r($arrayName)`
- This will print an array with their keys and their associated values. (NEAT!)
- Example:<br/>
`<?php`<br/>
&emsp;`$fruits = array("Type"=>"Citrus",1=>"Orange",2=>"Grapefruit",3=>"Lemon");//initializing associative array`<br/>
&emsp;`print_r($fruits);`<br/>
`?>`<br/><br/>
