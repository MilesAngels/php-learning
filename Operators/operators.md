# Operators <br/>
## What are operators?
- An operator is something that takes one or more values (or expressions, in programming jargon) and yields another value (so that the construction itself becomes an expression). 
<br/>

### Types of Operators
- arithmetic operators
- comparison operators
- logical operators
- assignment operators
<br/><br/>

## Arithmetic Operators
- Used to perform basic arithmetic and are divided into two categories:
    1. Binary Operators
    2. Unary Operators

### Binary Operators
- Binary operators are the ones that take two values and perform an arithmetic operation on them. They are listed below:
<br/>
| Operator |    Function    | Example   |<br/>
|:--------:|:--------------:|:---------:|<br/>
|     +    |    Addition    | \$a + \$b |<br/>
|     -    |   Subtraction  | \$a - \$b |<br/>
|     *    | Multiplication | \$a * \$b |<br/>
|     /    |    Division    | \$a / \$b |<br/>
|     %    |     Modulus    | \$a % \$b |<br/>
