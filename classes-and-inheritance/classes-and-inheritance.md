# Introduction To Classes
## What are Classes?
- Classes are the blueprints of objects. 
- A class contains both data and functions to form a package.
- A class is a user-defined data type, which includes local methods and local variables.

## What are Objects?
- An object is an individual instance of the data structure defined by a class.
- We define a class once and then make many objects.

### Inside an Object
- Objects are divided into two parts
    - property
    - method

#### Property 
- The variables inside the class or object

#### Method
- Refer to functions inside the class or object
