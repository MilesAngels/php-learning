# Strings
## String Interpolation
- The term interpolation refers to the insertion of a variable within a string. Interpolation works in double-quoted strings and the heredoc syntax only.
    - Example: <br/>
`<?php`<br/>
&emsp;`$name = 'Joel';`<br/>
&emsp;`echo "Hello $name, Nice to see you."; // $name will be replaced with "Joel"`<br/>
`?>`<br/><br/>
